# unless running inside an Anthropic-managed cloud VM (CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE=true),

#
# The heavy provisioning (Claude plugin pre-seed) lives in
# scripts/cc-web-setup.sh, which the web environment's *setup script* should run
# ONCE before the snapshot (`make cc-web-setup`) so plugin skills are available
# on the FIRST session — Claude enumerates skills at startup, so a plugin
# installed by this hook only surfaces next session. This per-session hook then:
#   * self-heals by running cc-web-setup.sh when the environment was not
#     pre-provisioned (on that path, plugin skills only arrive next session);
#   * provisions the portable per-session tooling a snapshot cannot carry: the
#     GitHub CLI (PR/CI automation) and the Codex CLI (a second opinion via
#     `codex exec`), persisting both on PATH for later Bash commands;
#   * sources an optional project hook (web-bootstrap.local.sh) for repo-specific
#     glue (language toolchains, container runtimes, git-hook wiring, …).
#
# This script is PORTABLE: it carries no project-specific dependencies. Anything
# specific to one repo belongs in scripts/web-bootstrap.local.sh (sourced below).
#
# Output discipline: SessionStart stdout is injected into Claude's context, so
# verbose tool output goes to $LOG and only concise status lines reach stdout.

# session start, so problems are logged and the script always exits 0.

  # — belongs in scripts/web-bootstrap.local.sh, sourced here if present. A subshell
  # inherits main()'s helpers and globals (log, $LOG, $PROJECT_DIR, $SUDO,
  # $CLAUDE_ENV_FILE, persist_path), so its file/system side effects persist.
  #
  # SECURITY/ISOLATION: web-bootstrap.local.sh is trusted, repo-owned code — the
  # same trust level as this committed hook. Running it in a SUBSHELL keeps a stray
  # `exit` (or `exit 1`) from breaking this hook's "always exit 0" discipline and
  # stops its variable edits from leaking back; it does NOT sandbox the code (a
  # project hook legitimately needs the session's git/gh credentials). Signal a
  # soft failure with a non-zero exit/return — it is logged, never fatal.
