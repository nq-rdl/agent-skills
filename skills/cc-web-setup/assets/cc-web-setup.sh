# cc-web-setup.sh — provision a Claude Code on the web (cloud) VM.
#
# Run this ONCE per environment from the web environment's *setup script* — the
# bash that runs before Claude starts and whose filesystem state is captured in
# the environment snapshot. It is exposed as `make cc-web-setup`.
#
# Why a setup-script step rather than (only) the SessionStart hook: Claude
# enumerates skills at process startup, BEFORE SessionStart hooks run. A plugin
# installed by the hook (scripts/web-bootstrap.sh) therefore only surfaces its
# skills on the NEXT session. Installing the plugin here — before the snapshot,
# before Claude starts — bakes it into the image so its skills are available on
# the FIRST session.
#
# Idempotent and safe to re-run: the plugin pre-seed is a cheap no-op when
# already current, and an optional project hook (cc-web-setup.local.sh) guards
# its own heavy work. The SessionStart hook also calls this as a self-heal for
# environments whose setup script does not run it (on that path the plugins'
# skills still arrive next session, because the hook runs after skill enumeration).
#
# This script is PORTABLE: it carries no project-specific dependencies. Project
# specifics (language toolchains, container runtimes, heavy installs) belong in
# an optional, gitignored-or-committed `scripts/cc-web-setup.local.sh` that this
# script sources if present — see the SOURCE PROJECT HOOK section below.
#
# Exit status reflects provisioning (0 = installed or skipped, non-zero =
# failed) so a setup script can surface provisioning failures; callers that must
# not fail (the SessionStart hook) invoke it with `|| …`.
#
# Output discipline: keep stdout concise — when run from the hook it is injected
# into Claude's context — so verbose tool output goes to $LOG.

# the hook) injected into the model context, where ANSI escapes are just noise.
