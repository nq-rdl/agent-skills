Pixi Pack
=========

```pixi-pack`` <https://github.com/quantco/pixi-pack>`__ is a simple
tool that takes an environment and packs it into a compressed archive
that can be shipped to the target machine. The corresponding
``pixi-unpack`` tool can be used to unpack the archive and recreate an
environment.

Both tools can be installed via

.. container:: language-bash highlight

   ::

      pixi global install pixi-pack pixi-unpack

Or by downloading our pre-built binaries from the `releases
page <https://github.com/Quantco/pixi-pack/releases>`__.

Instead of installing ``pixi-pack`` and ``pixi-unpack`` globally, you
can also use ``pixi exec`` to run ``pixi-pack`` in a temporary
environment:

.. container:: language-bash highlight

   ::

      pixi exec pixi-pack
      pixi exec pixi-unpack environment.tar

.. admonition::

   You can also write ``pixi pack`` (and ``pixi unpack``) if you have
   ``pixi``, and ``pixi-pack`` and ``pixi-unpack`` installed globally.

You can pack an environment with

.. container:: language-bash highlight

   ::

      pixi-pack --environment prod --platform linux-64 pixi.toml

This will create an ``environment.tar`` file that contains all conda
packages required to create the environment.

.. container:: language-text highlight

   ::

``pixi-unpack``: Unpacking an environment\ `# <#pixi-unpack-unpacking-an-environment>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With ``pixi-unpack environment.tar``, you can unpack the environment on
your target system. This will create a new conda environment in
``./env`` that contains all packages specified in your ``pixi.toml``. It
also creates an ``activate.sh`` (or ``activate.bat`` on Windows) file
that lets you activate the environment without needing to have ``conda``
or ``micromamba`` installed.

.. container:: language-bash highlight

   ::

      $ pixi-unpack environment.tar
      $ ls
      env/
      activate.sh
      environment.tar
      $ cat activate.sh
      export PATH="/home/user/project/env/bin:..."
      export CONDA_PREFIX="/home/user/project/env"
      . "/home/user/project/env/etc/conda/activate.d/activate_custom_package.sh"

Cross-platform Packs\ `# <#cross-platform-packs>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since ``pixi-pack`` just downloads the ``.conda`` and ``.tar.bz2`` files
from the conda repositories, you can trivially create packs for
different platforms.

.. container:: language-bash highlight

   ::

      pixi-pack --platform win-64

.. admonition::

   Note

   You can only unpack a pack on a system that has the same platform as
   the pack was created for.

Self-Extracting Binaries\ `# <#self-extracting-binaries>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can create a self-extracting binary that contains the packed
environment and a script that unpacks the environment. This can be
useful if you want to distribute the environment to users that don't
have ``pixi-unpack`` installed.

Custom pixi-unpack executable path\ `# <#custom-pixi-unpack-executable-path>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When creating a self-extracting binary, you can specify a custom path or
URL to a ``pixi-unpack`` executable to avoid downloading it from the
`default
location <https://github.com/Quantco/pixi-pack/releases/latest>`__.

You can provide one of the following as the ``--pixi-unpack-source``:

-  a URL to a ``pixi-unpack`` executable like
   ``https://my.mirror/pixi-pack/pixi-unpack-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl``
-  a path to a ``pixi-unpack`` binary like
   ``./pixi-unpack-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl``

Example Usage\ `# <#example-usage>`__
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Using a URL:

.. container:: language-bash highlight

   ::

      pixi-pack --create-executable --pixi-unpack-source https://my.mirror/pixi-pack/pixi-unpack-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl

Using a path:

.. container:: language-bash highlight

   ::

      pixi-pack --create-executable --pixi-unpack-source ./pixi-unpack-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl

.. admonition::

   Note

   The produced executable is a simple shell script that contains both
   the ``pixi-unpack`` binary as well as the packed environment.

Inject Additional Packages\ `# <#inject-additional-packages>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can inject additional packages into the environment that are not
specified in ``pixi.lock`` by using the ``--inject`` flag:

.. container:: language-bash highlight

   ::

      pixi-pack --inject local-package-1.0.0-hbefa133_0.conda pixi.toml

This can be particularly useful if you build the package itself and want
to include the built package in the environment but still want to use
``pixi.lock`` from the workspace.

PyPi support\ `# <#pypi-support>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also pack PyPi wheel packages into your environment.
``pixi-pack`` only supports wheel packages and not source distributions.
If you happen to use source distributions, you can ignore them by using
the ``--ignore-pypi-non-wheel`` flag. This will skip the bundling of
PyPi packages that are source distributions.

The ``--inject`` option also supports wheels.

.. container:: language-bash highlight

   ::

      pixi-pack --ignore-pypi-non-wheel --inject my_webserver-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl

.. admonition::

   Warning

   In contrast to injecting from conda packages, we cannot verify that
   injected wheels are compatible with the target environment. Please
   make sure the packages are compatible.

Mirror and S3 middleware\ `# <#mirror-and-s3-middleware>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use mirror middleware by creating a configuration file as
described in the `pixi
documentation <../../reference/pixi_configuration/#mirror-configuration>`__
and referencing it using ``--config``.

.. container:: language-toml highlight

   config.toml
   ::

      [mirrors]
      "https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge" = ["https://my.artifactory/conda-forge"]

If you are using `S3 in pixi <../s3/>`__, you can also add the
appropriate S3 config in your config file and reference it.

.. container:: language-toml highlight

   config.toml
   ::

      [s3-options.my-s3-bucket]
      endpoint-url = "https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com"
      region = "eu-central-1"
      force-path-style = false

Setting maximum number of parallel downloads\ `# <#setting-maximum-number-of-parallel-downloads>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. container:: language-toml highlight

   ::

      [concurrency]
      downloads = 5

Use ``pixi-pack --config config.toml`` to use the custom configuration
file. See `pixi
docs <../../reference/pixi_configuration/#concurrency>`__ for more
information.

Cache Downloaded Packages\ `# <#cache-downloaded-packages>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can cache downloaded packages to speed up subsequent pack operations
by using the ``--use-cache`` flag:

.. container:: language-bash highlight

   ::

      pixi-pack --use-cache ~/.pixi-pack/cache

This will store all downloaded packages in the specified directory and
reuse them in future pack operations. The cache follows the same
structure as conda channels, organizing packages by platform
subdirectories (e.g., linux-64, win-64, etc.).

Using a cache is particularly useful when:

-  Creating multiple packs with overlapping dependencies
-  Working with large packages that take time to download
-  Operating on machines with limited bandwidth
-  Running CI/CD pipelines where package caching can significantly
   improve build times

Unpacking Without pixi-pack\ `# <#unpacking-without-pixi-pack>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you don't have ``pixi-pack`` available on your target system, and do
not want to use self-extracting binaries (see above), you can still
install the environment if you have ``conda`` or ``micromamba``
available. Just unarchive the ``environment.tar``, then you have a local
channel on your system where all necessary packages are available. Next
to this local channel, you will find an ``environment.yml`` file that
contains the environment specification. You can then install the
environment using ``conda`` or ``micromamba``:

.. container:: language-bash highlight

   ::

      tar -xvf environment.tar
      micromamba create -p ./env --file environment.yml
      # or
      conda env create -p ./env --file environment.yml

.. admonition::

   Note

   The ``environment.yml`` and ``repodata.json`` files are only for this
   use case, ``pixi-unpack`` does not use them.

.. admonition::

   Note

   Both ``conda`` and ``mamba`` are always installing pip as a side
   effect when they install python, see ```conda``'s
   documentation <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/25.1.x/user-guide/configuration/settings.html#add-pip-as-python-dependency-add-pip-as-python-dependency>`__.
   This is different from how ``pixi`` works and can lead to solver
   errors when using ``pixi-pack``'s compatibility mode since ``pixi``
   doesn't include ``pip`` by default. You can fix this issue in two
   ways:

   -  Add ``pip`` to your ``pixi.lock`` file using ``pixi add pip``.
   -  Configuring ``conda`` (or ``mamba``) to not install ``pip`` by
      default by running
      ``conda config --set add_pip_as_python_dependency false`` (or by
      adding ``add_pip_as_python_dependency: False`` to your
      ``~/.condarc``)
