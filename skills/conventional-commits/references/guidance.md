# Conventional Commits Guidance

This document provides detailed guidelines based on the [Conventional Commits v1.0.0 specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

## Core Rules

1. Commits MUST be prefixed with a type (e.g., `feat`, `fix`), followed by the OPTIONAL scope, OPTIONAL `!`, and REQUIRED terminal colon and space.
2. The type `feat` MUST be used when a commit adds a new feature.
3. The type `fix` MUST be used when a commit represents a bug fix.
4. A scope MAY be provided after a type. A scope MUST consist of a noun describing a section of the codebase surrounded by parenthesis, e.g., `fix(parser):`.
5. A description MUST immediately follow the colon and space after the type/scope prefix. The description is a short summary of the code changes.
6. A longer commit body MAY be provided after the short description, providing additional contextual information about the code changes. The body MUST begin one blank line after the description.
7. A commit body is free-form and MAY consist of any number of newline separated paragraphs.
8. One or more footers MAY be provided one blank line after the body. Each footer MUST consist of a word token, followed by either a `:<space>` or `<space>#` separator, followed by a string value.
9. A footer's token MUST use `-` in place of whitespace characters, e.g., `Acked-by`. An exception is made for `BREAKING CHANGE`, which MAY also be used as a token.
10. A footer's value MAY contain spaces and newlines, and parsing MUST terminate when the next valid footer token/separator pair is observed.
11. Breaking changes MUST be indicated in the type/scope prefix of a commit, or as an entry in the footer.
12. If included as a footer, a breaking change MUST consist of the uppercase text `BREAKING CHANGE`, followed by a colon, space, and description.
13. If included in the type/scope prefix, breaking changes MUST be indicated by a `!` immediately before the `:`. If `!` is used, `BREAKING CHANGE:` MAY be omitted from the footer section.
14. Types other than `feat` and `fix` MAY be used (e.g., `docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`).
15. The units of information that make up Conventional Commits MUST NOT be treated as case-sensitive by implementors, with the exception of `BREAKING CHANGE` which MUST be uppercase.
16. `BREAKING-CHANGE` MUST be synonymous with `BREAKING CHANGE`, when used as a token in a footer.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does this relate to SemVer?
- `fix` type commits should be translated to PATCH releases.
- `feat` type commits should be translated to MINOR releases.
- Commits with `BREAKING CHANGE` in the commits, regardless of type, should be translated to MAJOR releases.

### What do I do if the commit conforms to more than one of the commit types?
Go back and make multiple commits whenever possible. Conventional Commits drives us to make more organized commits and PRs.

### Are the types in the commit title uppercase or lowercase?
Any casing may be used, but it's best to be consistent. Lowercase is the convention.

### How does Conventional Commits handle revert commits?
Conventional Commits does not make an explicit effort to define revert behavior. A common recommendation is to use the `revert` type, and a footer that references the commit SHAs that are being reverted:

```
revert: let us never again speak of the noodle incident

Refs: 676104e, a215868
```

### What if I accidentally use the wrong commit type?
- Prior to merging/releasing: Use `git rebase -i` to edit the commit history.
- After releasing: If the type is recognized by the spec but incorrect (e.g., `fix` instead of `feat`), cleanup depends on tools. If a non-spec type is used (e.g., `feet`), it will simply be missed by tools based on the spec.
