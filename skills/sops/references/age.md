# Encrypting with Age

[Age](https://age-encryption.org/) is a simple, modern, and secure tool for encrypting files. It is recommended to use age over PGP if possible.

## Encrypting

You can encrypt a file for one or more age recipients (comma separated) using the `--age` option or the `SOPS_AGE_RECIPIENTS` environment variable:

```bash
sops encrypt --age age1yt3tfqlfrwdwx0z0ynwplcr6qxcxfaqycuprpmy89nr83ltx74tqdpszlw test.yaml > test.enc.yaml
```

## Decrypting

When decrypting a file with the corresponding identity, SOPS will look for a text file named `keys.txt` located in a `sops` subdirectory of your user configuration directory.

- **Linux**: Looks for `keys.txt` in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sops/age/keys.txt`; falls back to `$HOME/.config/sops/age/keys.txt`.
- **macOS**: Looks for `keys.txt` in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sops/age/keys.txt`; falls back to `$HOME/Library/Application Support/sops/age/keys.txt`.

You can override the default lookup by:
- Setting the environment variable `SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE`
- Setting the `SOPS_AGE_KEY` environment variable directly to the key content
- Providing a command to output the age keys by setting the `SOPS_AGE_KEY_CMD` environment variable.

The contents of this key file should be a list of age X25519 identities, one per line. Lines beginning with `#` are considered comments and ignored.

## Using .sops.yaml

A list of age recipients can be added to `.sops.yaml` to make encryption easier for specific paths:

```yaml
creation_rules:
    - age: >-
        age1s3cqcks5genc6ru8chl0hkkd04zmxvczsvdxq99ekffe4gmvjpzsedk23c,
        age1qe5lxzzeppw5k79vxn3872272sgy224g2nzqlzy3uljs84say3yqgvd0sw
```

## Encrypting with SSH Keys

Encrypting with SSH keys via age is also supported by SOPS. You can use SSH public keys (`ssh-ed25519 AAAA...`, `ssh-rsa AAAA...`) as age recipients when encrypting a file.

When decrypting a file, SOPS will attempt to source the SSH private key as follows:
- From the path specified in environment variable `SOPS_AGE_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE`.
- From the output of the command specified in environment variable `SOPS_AGE_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_CMD`. (The output must provide a key that is not password protected.)
- From `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`.
- From `~/.ssh/id_rsa`.

*Note: Only `ssh-rsa` and `ssh-ed25519` are supported.*
